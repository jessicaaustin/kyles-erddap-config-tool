  summary: "Morro Bay BS1 Met station is located in the back of Morro Bay, CA and owned by California Polytechnic State University of San Luis Obispo. The station is mounted on a large tripod, resting on the seafloor. A Nova Lynx 100 Weather Station is fixed at 3 meters above MLLW to a pole extending from the tripod and reports the following in near real-time: wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, barometric pressure, precipitation, relative humidity, and solar radiation. The instrument is maintained and operated by San Luis Obispo Science and Ecosystem Alliance (SLOSEA), a part of the Cal Poly Center for Coastal Marine Sciences."
