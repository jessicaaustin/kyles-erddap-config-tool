  summary: "The Bodega Head shore station is a seawater intake site operated by the Bodega Marine Laboratory. The seawater intake is located at Horseshoe Cove on the ocean side of Bodega Head and has been active since 2003 and consists of various sensors that provide water temperature, conductivity and salinity. These nearshore sensors are part of the Central and Norther California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). They measure various water quality parameters at fixed points along the California coast."
