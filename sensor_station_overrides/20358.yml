  summary: "The Tiburon shore station is maintained by San Francisco State University. The station has been operational since 2002 and consists of both in-water and meteorological sensors. The in-water sensors are fixed to a pier and provide near-real time observations of water salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidity and pH. San Francisco State University - http://sfbeams.sfsu.edu/. These nearshore sensors are part of the Central and Norther California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). They measure various water quality parameters at fixed points along the California coast."
