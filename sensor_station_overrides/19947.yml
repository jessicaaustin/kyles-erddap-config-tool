  summary: "The Fort Point station is located at Fort Point Pier in San Francisco and consists of in-water and meterological sensors. The station has been operational since 2004. This station is maintained by staff of the Bodega Marine Lab and is part of the Bodege Ocean Observing Node (BOON) project. These nearshore sensors are part of the Central and Norther California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). They measure various water quality parameters at fixed points along the California coast."
