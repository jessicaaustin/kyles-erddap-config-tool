  summary: "The Morro Bay shore station is maintained by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The station has been operational since 2007 and consists of four sensors. This station is fixed to the North T-pier approximately one meter below the surface and located near the mouth of Morro Bay. These sensors provide near-real time observations of ocean water conductivity, salinity, temperature, depth, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidity and nitrate. These nearshore sensors are part of the Central and Norther California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). They measure various water quality parameters at fixed points along the California coast."
