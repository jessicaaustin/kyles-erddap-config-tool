  summary: "The Monterey shore station is maintained by Moss Landing Marine Labs. The station has been operational since 2012 and consists of in water sensors that are fixed to a pier sampling every 15 minutes. These sensors provide near-real time observations of ocean water salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidity and pH. These sensors provide near-real time observations of ocean water conductivity, salinity, temperature, depth, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidity and nitrate. These nearshore sensors are part of the Central and Norther California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). They measure various water quality parameters at fixed points along the California coast."
