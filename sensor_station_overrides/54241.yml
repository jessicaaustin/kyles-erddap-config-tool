  summary: "The San Luis Bay shore station is located on the Cal Poly Pier and is maintained by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The station has been operational since 2003 and consists of an automous profiler, a weather station, flow through seawater system, and a water current profiler. These nearshore sensors are part of the Central and Norther California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). They measure various water quality parameters at fixed points along the California coast."
