  summary: "The Indian Island shore station is maintained by the Wiyot Tribe's Natural Resources Department who share the data with Humboldt State University and CeNCOOS. The station has been operational since 2004 and consists of subsurface sensors mounted rigidly to a piling. The sensors provide near-real-time observations of water salinity, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH, depth, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Near real-time data from the sensor became available 2/19/16 and is available in 15 min increments. These nearshore sensors are part of the Central and Norther California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). They measure various water quality parameters at fixed points along the California coast."
