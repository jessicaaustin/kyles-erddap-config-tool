  summary: "The Carquinez shore station is located on the Cal Maritime pier and maintained by the Romberg Tiburon Center. The station has been operational since 2008 and consists of in-water sensors and a meteorological station. The water quality sensors provide near-real time observations of water salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidity and pH. This station is maintained by staff of the Romberg Tiburon Center and is part of the SFBEAMS project. These nearshore sensors are part of the Central and Norther California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). They measure various water quality parameters at fixed points along the California coast."
