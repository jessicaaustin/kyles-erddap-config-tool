        <att name="summary">Monthly, stratified-random sampling is conducted year-round in Tampa Bay, Charlotte Harbor, Northern and Southern Indian River Lagoon, Cedar Key, Apalachicola Bay, and Jacksonville using a 183-m large haul seine. Sampling is stratified on somewhat arbitrary geographical boundaries, within which the hydrographic and habitat parameters are more similar than the estuary as a whole. In some estuaries sampling is further stratified on the presence or absence of overhanging vegetation. This monitoring effort provides long-term data on relative abundance of estuarine fish and select invertebrate species inhabiting shoreline areas. This project involves data collection, collection of biological samples, management of a long-term database, and basic data summarization. These data and biological samples are then used for FIM research projects on estuarine fish species, populations, and communities (outlined in Level II: Fish Monitoring). The data and biological samples are also used by the FMRI stock assessment group in developing stock assessments for recreationally and commercially important fish species; by other FMRI research programs (e.g., Aquatic Health, Fisheries Genetics) and by research programs from other agencies.</att>

This term identifies a specific instant chosen to represent the date and time of the observation, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Both date and time are specified in this term in order to facilitate some searches and services that require resolution of events to this level of precision in time. Some observation events occur with uncertainty at the level of minutes, hours, or even days or more. A nominal event date and time is determined, even for observations with date and time uncertainty, for IOOS services to best represent the instant of the event. The companion term, nominalObservationDateTimeUncertainty, defines an interval of uncertainty that quantifies precision to correspond to the precision the original data recorded. Methods for determining nominal time and uncertainty will be documented in metadata, and they can be explained (if concise) in the "observationDateTimeAnnotation" term.</att>

In this example, biomass would not be obtained at survey time, rather biomass would be calculated from input data that was obtained at survey time, combined with a biomass calculation methodology. This term is used along with companion terms for quantification value, units, uncertainty, method, and determination details. It is suggested that names for derived values be more specific than "Biomass", because many institutions will develop biomass information using diverse methods.

Many marine data rely strictly on geographic coordinates, so the locality term may be null. If a locality is used, it may be a specific location or feature name, such as "Pier 39" or "Atafu Atoll", or it may include a descriptive phrase, such as "a tidal pool 1500 meters north of Pier 39". Note that in marine observations, the latitude and longitude may be more precise than any named place would suggest, because the coordinates often come from navigation of GPS systems. Geographic names can be secondary locality identifiers and they can be less precise than coordinates.</att>
